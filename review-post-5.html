				<h1>A Shocking Start to a Shocking Series</h1>
				<p>The first episode of "Black Mirror" is a brutal, uncompromising, and deeply uncomfortable watch. It's a story about a prime minister who is forced to perform a depraved act on live television to save a kidnapped princess. The episode is a scathing satire of our media-obsessed culture, and it's a powerful statement of intent for the series. However, it's also a difficult and unpleasant watch, and it's not for the faint of heart.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>"We're all watching. We're all part of it."</p>
				</blockquote>
				<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
				<p>A bold and unforgettable start to the series, but it's one that will likely divide audiences. It's a powerful piece of television, but it's not one that I'll be revisiting anytime soon.</p>
