							<h2 class="project-section-heading">Background</h2>
							<p style="padding-bottom: 2rem;">
								With the growth of Google's Grasshopper, Khan Academy, and Coursera; it has become more
								apparent that the democratisation of technical skills is providing individuals of diverse
								backgrounds access to solely technical knowledge. Roots and its first learning module in Facial Recognition are designed to fill the void of bridging
								technical and ethical education by deconstructing technical concepts and engaging in critical discussion
								of the potential uses of the product and who is affected positively and adversely.
							</p>
							<p class="bold-sentence" style="display:none;">I was the sole designer of the founding team.</p>
							<p>
								I led the development of Roots and its Facial Recognition module as part of a team of 4 students. I oversaw development
								of software to be used in the interactive demos, created an overall strategy for the product, and tracked their progress throughout the project.
								Additionally, I implemented interactive demos and designed the Roots platform.
							</p>
							<p>
								I've grown tremendously in the course of this project, some key achievements of which I have listed below:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p><b>Turned an idea into a product. </b>I worked closely with my team
										and research lab to shape the product vision and strategy of its learning platform. In doing so, I have improved
										my management skills through practicing prioritization, communication, and
										building a clear process for team members and myself to implement changes.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><b>Juggled many different roles. </b>Working in the early-stages of this product was exciting as I
										dedicated hours of my spare time and weekends conducting user research, sketching mockups, testing software and designing the
										interactive demos alongside coordinating team members and writing code.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><b>Conducted the design process. </b>Through this project I designed and implemented the front-end for this project. My
										process was gathering user research, following design principles, and user testing. 
									</p>
								</li>

							<h2 class="project-section-heading">Defining the Problem Statement</h2>
							<div class="sub-heading-container">
								<h4 class="sub-heading">Motivation</h4>
								<p class="sub-heading-content">
									We wanted to use the Facial Recognition learning module as an opportunity to explain  technical processes that people
									experience every day but may not be aware of its innerworkings. After reading about the ethical, legal, and social
									ramifications of these technologies, we found that sources of critical analysis did not emphasize the technical and technical
									resources did not stress ethics.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="sub-heading-container">
								<h4 class="sub-heading">User Personas</h4>
								<div class="sub-heading-content">
									<p>
										Based on our research, we recognised that there were 2 key user types that our product was applicable. We decided to
										focus on these personas since their need was greatest and we could reach them via universities and educational programs.
									</p>

								<h4 class="sub-heading">Brainstorming</h4>
								<div class="sub-heading-content">
									<p style="padding-bottom:2rem;">
										Glancing towards existent learning platforms, objectives we needed to fulfill
										was a platform that prioritized the modules and made navigation within each learning module
										intuitive. Challenges in the development of the Facial Recognition module were defining an audience
										of the module and creating an approachable method to explain technical programming concepts such as
										machine learning, algorithms, and time complexity to people of non-technical backgrounds. To combat this,
										we excluded programming skills and abstracted programming concepts to teach users what these concepts do without
										overwheling them with technical specifics.
									</p>
									<p>
										Taking our ideas to paper + pencil, we landed on creating a clearly outlined process for Facial Recognition:
										<ol style="margin-block-start:0em;">
										<li>Facial Detection</li>
										<li>Facial Mapping</li>
										<li>Facial Comparison</li>
										<li>Facial Recognition</li>
									</p>
									<img class="project-example" style="margin-top:2rem; padding:0; margin:0;" src="assets/images/roots-project/scanned-work.png">
							</div>
							</div>
							<div class="sub-heading-container">
								<h4 class="sub-heading">Protoyping</h4>
								<p class="sub-heading-content">
									In order to prototype my idea, I first drew out a simple storyboard.
									Once my ideas were organized, we then took to PowerPoint to
									create a mid-fidelity mock-up.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="sub-heading-container">
								<h4 class="sub-heading">User Testing</h4>
								<div class="sub-heading-content">
									<p>
										Although our prototype was still a ways off from the final product, we conducted testing with
										5 users. We drew 3 main insights from our testing:
									</p>
									<ol style="margin-block-start:0em;">
										<li>
											There was no clear navigational process or indication of the next page in the course.
										</li>
										<li>
											Lack of user control - users wanted a way to easily access where there are in the course
											without having to scroll all the way up and backtracking.
										</li>
										<li>
											Inconsistencies with formatting - users found the interactive demo element confusing because,
											at times, it would be a video, picture, or gif. Our design lacked continuation from one step to the next that gives the demos
											a cohesive feel.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="sub-heading-container">
								<h4 class="sub-heading">Software Development</h4>
								<p class="sub-heading-content">
									To develop the product, I used HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript to build the Roots learning platform. In order to further
									learners understanding of technical concepts, I built interactive demonstrations of Facial Recognition concepts like facial mapping, and facial comparison
									using Python and Flask.

					<div class="project-result">
						<div class="project-text-container">
							<h2 class="project-section-heading">Results & Reflection</h2>
							<p>
								Initiating, designing, and developing this product was an extremely rewarding experience. It re-affirmed
								my interest in software enginnering and exploring the intersection of technology and education. Further, challenges
								I faced were communication with my team, learning new technologies, and designing a meaningful UX. In the beginning
								of the project, everyone on my team had differing visions of who the target users were, the content of the learning module,
								and what tools were to be used in building the product. I resolved this by developing clear user personas to give tangible
								meaning to what constitutes our user base. This project ignited my interest in front-end engineering in my task to design and implement the learning platform
								and course module. I gained invaluable experience with Jekyll, Adobe InDesign, Figma, JavaScript, and Ruby.
							</p>
							<p>
								Some key takeaways from this project are:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li><p>
									<b>Clear communication is key.</b> There is only so much work that can be completed on your own. It is important to
									be transparent with your team members about your progress and ideas.
								</p></li>
								<li><p>
									<b>Don't worry too much about the detail.</b> Earlier in my journey, I made the mistake of
									worrying about the look of the UI. Taking a step back and reassessing the user flows helped me
									to reprioritize the UX.
								</p></li>
								<li><p>
									<b>Focus on the problem.</b> In the beginning of development, I was focused too much on selecitng the best tools to
									create the best solution; however, reframing to focus on the problem and user personas clarified our product and next
									steps in the process.
								</p></li>
