										Peer Mentor Portal (PMP) is an online resource for experienced and new teaching assistants/peer mentors alike which acts
										as a collection of tips, tricks, and tall tales from seasoned PMs as well as instructions from faculty. As a 3-time
										PM for beginner and experiences Computer Science courses I am familiar with the confusion of instructing for the first time, holding office hours, or
										or attempting to help students with topics you are unfamiliar with.
									</p>
									<p class="project-specifics">
										This is an independent project that I designed and built to help guide future PMs. The goal of this project
										is to develop my front-end skills using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS/SASS as well as my design skills.

								<h2 class="project-section-heading">Background</h2>
								<p>
									When I was a first-time PM, there were no established resources to learn about teaching or familiarize yourself
									with material in the course you are supporting. Speaking with an Computer Science alum from Northwestern, I learned there used to be
									PM guides created by senior PMs. They would be circulated based on course and existed mostly as PDFs which they found difficult becasue it was an
									inflexible format. Identifying this need for resources for PMs, I spoke with PMs and professors on what could be created to better equip PMs and their
									students which culminated in this project, Peer Mentor Portal.
								</p>
								<p class="bold-sentence">I am the founder of this project.</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<p><b>Identified a need and turned into a product.</b> The Peer Mentor Portal is an idea I had to solve a critical need and the
											experience of building on that idea and ganiing support from others was exciting. Through this process, it further
											taught me to always gain feedback from users on their needs and the usability of the product.
										</p>

								<h2 class="project-section-heading">Understanding the Problem</h2>
								<div class="sub-heading-container">
									<h4 class="sub-heading">Problem Statement</h4>
									<div class="sub-heading-content">
										<p>
											The problem I found was that PMs did not have a resource for them to learn teaching skills,
											refresh on course material, and share their experiences with other PMs. From my conversations with PMs I learned there is a
											cycle with PMs in the Computer Science Department.
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>PM is new and is unfamiliar with teaching and course material.</li>
											<li>PM learns more about the course, asks seasoned PMs and professors, and grows more comfortable teaching students from practice.</li>
											<li>PM becomes a seasoned PM after PMing multiple times ang growing confident in their teaching skills.</li>
											<li>They graduate.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>
											PMs once they learn and feel comfortbale in their position, often graduate leaving new PMs facing the same issues again and again.
											The Peer Mentor Portal needs to collect information from new and seasoned PMs in order to build on experiences and shared knowledge.

										The format of an online resource was selected because it is a flexible and inexpensive way to
										disseminate information amongst professors and PMs. Also, in the design process the following user personas were considered:
										a professor looking to instruct their PMs through a course guide, new PM looking for guidance, or a seasoned PM answering questions.

						<div class="project-result">

								<h2 class="project-section-heading">Results & Reflection</h2>
								<p>
									I built this website and presented it to Computer Science Faculty. The Peer Mentor Portal is now in the process
									of being adopted by Northwestern University's Computer Science Department for Fall 2020.
								</p>
								<p>
									Some key takeaways from this project are:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li><p>
										<b>Be impact focused.</b> Through the course of this project, I learned to focus on the impact
										my product could have on my user personas and how it can be expanded in future iterations.
									</p></li>
									<li><p>
										<b>First impressions matter.</b> I wanted to prioritize the user experience and create a seamless and simple experience
										for users to easily find what they are looking for.
									</p></li>
									<li><p>
										<b>Build the most important functionality first.</b> At the beginning of this project, I wanted to build a chat feature,
										feature for each specific class and, a live chat feature to contact professors. However, upon recieving user feedback,
										I stripepd down my product to its most important functionality.
									</p></li>
