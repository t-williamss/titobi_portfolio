						<p class="about-description">
							I believe technology has the ability to improve the lives of others in its applications. I am a student at Northumbria University researching how to design wearables intentionally for global communities.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<h2 class="value-section-heading">MY VALUES:</h2>
							<li>
								<h3 class="value-heading">🙏🏾Be Humble.</h3>
								<p>There is always something to learn from someone else regardless of who they are or who you think you are. Respect is not something to be earned. It is something to be given to others as we are all people doing our best.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3 class="value-heading">✊🏾All of us.</h3>
								<p>Inclusion is more than a buzzword, inclusion is a principle that needs to be applied in the software development process. In all my projects, I have strived to make them physically and culturally accessible. Technology cannot be a tool of the future, if it is maintaining the prejudices of the past.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3 class="value-heading">🤓Live and learn.</h3>
								<p>I am constantly learning from my experiences, blogs, and my family’s advice. People are works in progress and I seek to challenge myself and grow by placing myself in new environments.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h3 class="value-heading">🚫No bad vibes.</h3>
								<p>Rihanna once tweeted: “Not today, Satan.” I seek to embody that energy in my daily life. I actively try to radiate positivity towards others through being kind, empathetic, and patient.</p>
